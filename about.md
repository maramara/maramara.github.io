## My process

I truly believe that everyone is a designer—they just might need a bit of help to shape their ideas into something great. This is where I see my role—as a designer, it's my job to steer people towards a shared understanding of the problem and to explore different options in a collaborative and transparent way.

In my work, I strive to:     

- Make and document data-informed decisions
- Share knowledge and mentor people    
- Be a critical thinker     
- Be a good communicator

I approach projects by:   
  
- **Conducting research** to understand the user and business needs better 
- **Identifying opportunities** and ideating on possible solutions
- **Validating potential solutions** internally and externally (user feedback sessions, wireframes, clickable prototypes)     
- **Implementing successful solutions** by breaking down designs into reusable UI components    
- **Tracking the success of the solution** by gathering qualitative and quantitative feedback (user acceptance tests, usability studies, data tracking)
