## My process

I use the Design Thinking methodology as a solid background for solving problems from a human-centered perspective.

Since each project has it’s unique set of problems and requirements, the methodology can be adjusted to best optimize for speed and execution. I have a solid experience in applying Design Thinking in an agile environment (in a form of 3-5 day design sprints or as half day Lean UX workshops).

I approach projects by:   
  
- **Conducting research** to understand the users better (competitor analysis,  user interview, persona, customer journey) 
- **Forming user stories** & ideating on possible solutions (iterative process)     
- **Validating potential solutions** (mostly through wireframes and clickable prototypes)     
- **Implementing successful solutions** into distinct components of the UI that can  be reused     
- **Tracking the success of the solution** by gathering feedback (user acceptance tests, usability studies)

In my work, I strive to:     

- Make and document data-informed decisions     
- Be a critical thinker     
- Be a good communicator
