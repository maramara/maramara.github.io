## My process

As a designer, my aim is to steer people towards a shared understanding of the problem, and to explore options in a 
collaborative and transparent way with my product and engineering counterparts.

In my work, I strive to:     

- Make and document data-informed decisions
- Share knowledge and connect the dots between different business areas
- Be a critical thinker, crisp communicator, and swift executor

I approach projects by:   
  
- Conducting research to understand the user and business context 
- Identifying opportunities, ideating, and iterating on possible solutions
- Validating potential solutions and tracking their success over time
