## Introduction 

Memgraph is the world's first real-time distributed graph database, which aims to deliver high-performance at enterprise scale. 
It is engineered to support the needs of enterprises with colossal amounts of data. Memgraph aims to help businesses harness the power of real-time connected data, so they can build the next generation of intelligent applications.


## Problem space

 Memgraph's Demo Applications need to showcase live previews of different datasets in order to better represent the product’s functionalities to prospective clients. 
Use cases cover industries such as telecommunication, finance or IT network management. The demos are usually presented at meetings and on trade shows and need to be quickly developed and adjusted.
