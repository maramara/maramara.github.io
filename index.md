## What I do
 I have a background in information and communication science. I bring to the table a multidisciplinary skillset that integrates creative knowledge, human-centered design and technical expertise. 
 I am able to facilitate design process with cross-functional teams and across business value streams. 
 
 I also like to fiddle with some CSS.
