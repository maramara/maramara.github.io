## What I do
With a background in information and communication science, I specialize in translating business objectives into user-centered design solutions that drive measurable results.

I lead cross-functional teams to identify key problems and create solutions that enhance user experience, boost engagement, and support business growth. 
Sometimes, I <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@marstupa">write about design</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/maramaramara/pens/public">tinker with CSS art</a>.
